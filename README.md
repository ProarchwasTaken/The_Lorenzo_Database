# How to use

All you had to do is download **Release 1.2**, extract the folder and run **database.exe**. It used to be so much more complicated than that.

# Final thoughts

So what do you think? I know it ain't much but I'm pretty proud of it considering the skill level I'm on. I don't care about what you do with the code, you can change it however you like. Would appreciate your feedback though.

As a matter of fact, I've been thinking about saving this program on a usb stick and adding this program to public computers to see what people will do with it. Anyway, think for taking time out of your day to check this out!
