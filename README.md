# The Lorenzo Database

# How to use

I recommend loading this in Windows Command Prompt for the best experience. ~~Totally not because it won't work anywhere else but if you do find of way than more power to you.~~

All you need is python and so far this works for Python **3.9**

Once you downloaded the file, unzip it and put the tld_database folder into a safe place. Now open cmd prompt and enter this command:
```cd <Replace this with path to tld_database>\tld_database & python main.py```

If you want quick access, then I suggest saving a shortcut of cmd prompt and adding this to the end of **target:**
``` /k cd <Replace this with path to tld_database>\tld_database & python main.py```

# Final thoughts

So what do you think? I know it ain't much but I'm pretty proud of it considering the skill level I'm on. I don't care about what you do with the code, you can change it however you like. Would appreciate your feedback though.

As a matter of fact, I've been thinking about saving this program on a usb stick and adding this program to public computers to see what people will do with it. Anyway, think for taking time out of your day to check this out!
